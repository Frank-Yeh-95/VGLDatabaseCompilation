This is a repository of supplemental files of ion channels in: [citation]

Particularly, these are all of the sequence alignment, structural alignment, and parsed clinical variants files.

__Supplemental files 1-8, 17-22 are MSA files under a .fa format.__ <br/>
  Supplemental files 1-3, 17 are voltage- vs non-voltage-gated channel comparisons of TM2-4, 1, respectively.<br/>
  Supplemental files 4, 18-19 are ion selective channel comparisons of the Pore Helix, TM5-6, respectively.<br/>
  Supplemental files 5-8, 20-22 are domain-swapping channel comparisons of the TM2-3 & 5-6, TM1 & S4 & Pore Helix, respectively.<br/>

__Supplemental files 9-14 are parsed clinical variants tables by each transmembrane segment.__ <br/>
  Supplemental file 9-14 is TM2-TM6.<br/>

__Supplemental file 23-24 are the pymol structural visualization files for visualizing the structures of all the channels.__ <br/>
  Supplemental file 23 is the pymol file for VSD structural alignments. <br/>
  Supplemental file 24 is the pymol file for PGD structural alignments. <br/>
